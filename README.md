# Panel-Methods-and-Airfoil-Customization
This Respository serves to Document my explorations into the Aerodynamic design process. This repository contains python code for Creating/modifying airfoils, Conducting Airfoil Analysis using panel methods, and much more. It is also important to note that I am not a software engineer/engineering student so thus alot of the formalities usually taken have been ignored, so pardon my ignorance.
